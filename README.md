# Warner Bros Code Challenge

## ToDo Or Not ToDo App

The application is a todo list which first displays a set of users and then allows viewing the todo list of each by clicking on the user. Clicking on a new user will load a new todo list from that user.

Todo lists allow completing/uncompleting individual items via a checkbox, as well as deleting via the trash icon. New todos can be created by using the text input field and clicking the add button.

We also allow showing additional user information via the info button.

## Getting up and running

Load `index.html` in an up-to-date Chrome desktop browser

## Running tests

Tests run as part of application loading (from `tests.js`), with output displayed in the console

## Notes

I kept styling and organization minimal to try to keep to time constraints and maintain the no-framework spirit of the assignment. Documentation blocks are done in JSDoc style (https://devdocs.io/jsdoc/).

## Roadmap

- Improve data modeling for testing, clarity, and to minimize side effects
- Add responsive support
- Include additional user information
